## README

This repository contains a recreation of Dr. John Snow's map of the 1854 cholera epidemic in London, along with interactive visualizations that provide insights into the outbreak. The project aims to showcase the importance of data visualization in understanding complex patterns and mitigating the effects of such outbreaks.

### Description

The recreated visualization focuses on mapping the locations of major cholera incidents to water pumps in the area. By visually representing the data, we can identify patterns and gain a deeper understanding of the outbreak and its causes. The project includes a timeline chart, a map visualization, and pie charts depicting variations in deaths by age and gender.

### Methodology

The design process involved creating multiple visual elements to effectively communicate the data. The initial design included separate pie charts to represent deaths by gender, but it was later revised to a singular pie chart for a more comprehensive representation. The final design centers around the timeline chart, with additional visualizations placed below it. Users can toggle between age and gender data on the map visual using a selection radio button.

### Insights

Through the visualizations, several key insights were discovered:

1. The visualization revealed that deaths were more prevalent among individuals above 80 years old and children below 10 years old. This suggests that factors such as immunity variations and advanced age played a significant role in the occurrence of deaths.

2. The timeline bar graph highlighted a peak in deaths between August 30th and September 11th. During this period, the age group above 80 was particularly affected, accounting for approximately one-third of the overall deaths.

3. The street map visualization indicated a concentration of deaths around the pumps located on Jeremyn Street and Bond Street. These pumps, with potentially contaminated water, likely contributed to the spread of the cholera epidemic to consumers.
